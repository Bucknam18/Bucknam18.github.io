    <h1>Vans</h1>

<head>Vans are really cool shoes because most of them are all the same except for the color. Vans has been making the same exact pair of shoes for a very long time now and the popularity in their shoes continues to grow. Their shows not only look cool but they are used for people who skateboard. The main purpose of the shoes is for skateboarding but they have turned into a form of style for people who dont skateboard.</head>

<body>Vans most popular style of shoe are the "Old Skool" which comes in high tops and ankle. I really enjoy vans and I currently own a white pair and a black pair. I like Vans because they are simple and they work with most types of clothing that you would want to wear with them.</body>
