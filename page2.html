    <h1>NMDs</h1>

<head>NMDs are another one of my favorite pairs of shoes. They have a unique look and are extremely comfortable</head>

<body>NMDs are one of Adidas's newest shoes that came out around 2 years ago, NMDs became very popular very quickly and every store ended up selling all different colors of the Adidas NMD shoe</body>
<body>These NMDs are from the set of the "Tri Color" Adidas NMDs, They are called "Tri Color" because the three stripes on the shoe are a different color.</body>
<p>The links below go to a photo of both of the shoes and shows prices of each pair</p>
